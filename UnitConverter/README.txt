This is one of the first web applications I made. It uses JSTL for reading data into the UI, not AJAX.
The focus for this project was making an extensible, modular application. Any extension to include additional units
within the categories already supported requires only four new lines of code, from the front end to the back end.
Any support for new categories simply requires a new Ops implementation to perform the actual conversion and
two lines of JavaScript.
